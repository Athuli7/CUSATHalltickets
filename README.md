2. **Don't** contact me directly if there is an issue ! Raise it in issues. 
3. It's not my fault if your hall ticket isn't here. It may not even be my scripts fault. It could be because of that stupid server.
4. If the photo isn't perfect, goto http://exam.cusat.ac.in and download it yourself.
5. Right now, this has to be manually run, I'll put up a request page later.
6. Github pages doesn't have a directory listing option. Indexes have to be generated manually. Any help would be appreciated. 
7. I need to fine tune the Register numbers I check ! It would be great if someone could help out with this.
